<button type="button" id="header1" class="headerbutton">Why Monetize</button>
<div class="content">
  <span class="contentpar">
    <br> <br>
    Monetization is the natural next step when producing and sharing content with masses of people. Content monetization is leveraging content so that the consumption of your hard work earns you back money. Users can pay you directly for access to your content or premium goods, or a third party can pay you for your access to certain audiences. Details on different ways to monetize are covered in following sections, but it’s first important to understand that content is work, and work deserves pay!
    <br> <br>
    Just like any other worker contributing to their economy and sustaining themselves, creators and influencers share valuable products in the form of knowledge, entertainment, community, and much more. Serving an audience through digital platforms lets you connect with tens to millions of people at once, and that is no easy feat. Do not believe your work is not of value.
    <br><br>
    <p class="italicizedtext">"I think it is ok for authors to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them "content") in order to gain income (the term "compensation" falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages)." - Richard Stallman</p>
    <br> <br>
    If you know or have experience in a particular subject or niche, already run a content platform, have a lot of engagement from followers, have means to invest time into your platform, or simply have a passion to get started- content monetization will be a fantastic way to support yourself financially while contributing good to the world. Just as Procure is here to guide you because of our support for the creators in the world, you can serve your audience in your own genuine and noble intention.

    <br>

<button type="button" id="header3" class="headerbutton">Business Models and Monetization Tools</button>
<div class="content">
  <span class="contentpar">
    <p class="subhead">With a variety of ways to monetize your content and community, it’s essential to focus on what models work best for you. </p> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Merchandise</p>
    Merchandise is a great monetization option in being direct to your audience and acting as a clean and simple additive revenue generator. Not only this, but merchandise in itself promotes your brand and content once it leaves your hands, and promotes morale and community bond with you and your audience. The strength of your community bond is essential for all revenue generation, so merchandise can be a tool that hits multiple birds with one stone.
    <br> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Ads</p>
    Advertisements is one of the largest revenue generating arms of online business, continually growing and generating over $150 billion US dollars globally in 2021 from just social media advertisements. Creators who utilize social media and web platforms as a primary host for their business and content can sell ad slots, features, and promotions for pay based on various fee arrangements: fixed fees (or “fee per impression”: a flat fee paid for advertisement display rights), cost-per-click (fees determined based on the number of user clicks for a particular link or advertisement), and cost-per-thousand (a flat rate fee for every one thousand views). You can think of this as your audience being the product you sell, rather than you selling content to your audience.
    <br> <br>Arranging ad deals with marketers can be a stable and profitable business model to work off of, although note that securing ad deals necessitates audience engagement thus some sort of working user base. An ad business model does not promote discoverability or brand growth from the gecko, and can even damage creator-audience bonds in harming reputations of authenticity.
    <br> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Licensing and Royalties</p>

    Licensing and royalties is not only a useful monetization tool, but essential to protecting the content you create if your business includes the sales of your products. With today’s age in mass content production, your products can be sold with no legal consequence if there’s no backing for ownership. You should be the one collecting royalties made off your creative and intellectual property, so having licensing and royalties as revenue generation alongside other business models for brand expansion can be a great overarching strategy. Further, licensing can be particularly powerful if you run a business based on user generated content, which can cut the labor of generating your own products while having users submit their rights to you in return for a cut of profit made off the monetization of the published product. Strategizing the profits of selling content to media outlets while paying a certain cost for licensing can be powerful in ensuring your products are unique and marketable.
    <br> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Subscriptions</p>

    Depending on the type of content you offer, subscription models can offer reliable recurring revenue with easier financial management and forecasting. Community loyalty can be tracked and managed, with reduced churn and higher retention rates. More of your content will be distributed consistently with lower customer acquisition costs, but necessitate a consistent production of content offering to retain and grow your subscribing audience. A great compromise for those unsure if their existing audience could acclimate to a subscription business model would be in a premium subscription alongside your normal content offerings as an additive source of revenue.
    <br> <br>With different platforms, subscriptions can range in their offerings, whether it be a subscription cost for access to your content at all or a subscription for a bundle of premium content.
    <br> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Sponsorships and Brand Deals</p>
    Sponsorships and brand deals can be a fantastic source of revenue in ways similar to the ad business model in that it is a partnership for exposure as well. However, sponsorships and brand deals can offer more than just a fee arrangement in associating your own brand with another. Exposure, reputation, and engagement can be linked through the companies and creators you partner with, which necessitates good strategy for your personal branding image. Good reputation through partner associations can be hugely beneficial for audience growth, but bad partnership decisions can damage all the same. Brand deals do not necessarily have to include a fee arrangement at all, partnerships can be made for just a trade of exposure between creators and companies with similar audiences.
      <br> <br>Similarly to ad deals, sponsorships and brand deals are more effective the larger your user base and engagement is. Brand deals may be even harder to negotiate and secure due to its factors of linked brand identity. However, brand deals and sponsorships are more likely to promote discoverability and audience growth than ad sales if partnerships are strategized well.
    <br> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Tours and Events</p>
    With a strong community and audience base, tours and events can be a great option to consider. Not only can they be hugely profitable, but direct community engagement and loyalty can be established through personable or live events. Whether it be a casual meet and greet at a popular park or a million dollar global music tour, tours and events should not be neglected by content creators looking to expand their business.
      <br> <br>

    <p class="subhead">Donations</p>
    With certain platforms, donation from your audience can be more common and profitable than one might expect. Twitch streamers, Instagrammers, etc regularly receive donations from live stream viewers, with certain platforms offering built in donation options to interact with your content. And with a strong community, loyal followers may naturally want to support and communicate gratitude for your content monetarily without a particular product they are purchasing.

<button type="button" id="header4" class="headerbutton">Selecting a Platform</button>
<div class="content">
  <span class="contentpar">

    <p class="subhead">In selecting which media platform to invest your efforts into, it’s important to understand what makes each platform special. Match your content’s strengths and business focus to the platform that will best accelerate the growth of your community. Below are a few popular options.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subhead">YouTube: ADS</p>

    YouTube is a superpower in On Demand, Long Form content. What makes YouTube such a great option is their structured source for monetization through ads. Google Adsense and its powerful ad recommendation algorithm that’s built into the platform does the work for you.
    <br><br>
    Incorporating ads is clear and accessible for creators, and the platform has recently made its shift into live and short form content as well. If you’re looking for minimal work for consistent monetization, Youtube might be a great platform for you.
    <br><br>
    While YouTube is decent in discoverability, creators must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time to join YouTube’s Partner Program. But once your audience is more steady, YouTube can be hugely profitable with its ad algorithm and potential for higher paying brand partnerships in featuring products in long form videos.
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="subhead">Twitch: COMMUNITY</p>

    Twitch is an interactive livestreaming platform that offers an expansive monetization tool set. Twitch’s real strength is engaging and strengthening community bonds, as creators directly interact with their viewers on a multitude of different content forms. Strong community engagement is always essential, but Twitch offers 1P tools that directly monetize interaction with subscriptions and Bits.
    <br><br>
    Unlike other popular social media platforms, subscriptions to a creator have a fee of $4.99 a month for access to emotes and extra benefits. Bits entails viewers purchasing virtual goods to cheer during a stream, including animated emotes to amplify voice in chat. These are two popular interactive monetization tools, but Twitch affiliates and partners can run ads, have sponsorships, become Amazon associates, etc. Twitch’s creator camp outlines just how expansive monetization can be on the platform, although note partners and affiliates must have at least 500 total minutes broadcast, an average of 3 concurrent viewers or more, at least 50 followers, and at least 7 unique broadcasts in the last 30 days.
    While Twitch can be hugely profitable with regular streams and a consistent viewer base, the platform has poor discoverability so it is difficult to secure the loyal community to utilize these monetization tools on.

    <br><br><br>
    <p class="subhead">TikTok: DISCOVERY</p>

    TikTok is a platform with a powerful algorithm that points users to relevant content. This means hype-niche content can gain traction quickly and reach scales of audiences that other platforms take years to reach. Growth and discovery is TikTok’s superpower, so it’s an amazing tool to expand your audience, although note that growth is often runaway growth if you are not careful to connect your audience to a separate platform with where bonds can be fostered. Low level bonds, i.e. the amount of engagement or the return of a user to the same profile, can make monetization directly from TikTok difficult.
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="subhead">Instagram: BRAND</p>

    Instagram is the home of lifestyle influencers. You’ll see a lot of celebrity content, small businesses, etc, as Instagram is a fantastic hub for brand identity and development. The primary monetization opportunities through Instagram are in brand deals and sponsorships, and the platform in recent years has incorporated different creator programs and tools to help connect content creators with brands directly. Creators can make business portfolios in-app to showcase their content style and audience reach, and connect with brands directly to negotiate partnerships. And of course, Instagram is a great platform to host and develop your own brand name beside external monetization.
    <br><br>
    Instagram is going through a lot of changes, transforming into a business forward platform for content creators, although it is also pushing runaway growth models similar to TikTok through short form reels. This boost in discovery may be great in pairing with brand deal opportunities, although its potential is not set at this time.
